===================================================================

Day 6 was by far one of the hardest days of my life! I knew it was going
to be a hard lab day but i was not expecting such easy, already taught
questions to bother me the way they did. The day was very awful and very
disappointing until something downed on me that made this experience worth
while

WORKING ON HARD PROBLEMS DEVELOPS YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS!!!

I really didn't understand this until i stopped everything i was doing and
said i couldn't do it. But the truth was i just needed to work on my problem
solving skills.
