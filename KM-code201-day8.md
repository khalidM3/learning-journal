              #KM CODE 201 DAY 8
===============================================================================

If it is one thing i have learned while at Code Fellows, it is that nothing comes
easily in life. I mean nothing! I know int sounds cliche' but i have to
persevere everyday not understanding everything i have learned but stay
optimistic that i will in a few more days.

I have leaned about forms and tables but as I always say, easier read then done!
One other thing is that i don't know if the TAs are helping me too much. It seems
like i can not get anywhere without them

The Biggest goal I have for myself now is to learn how to research things i
don't know on the internetz and not just rely on people to help me.
