                 #KM CODE 201 DAY 11
===============================================================================

The following week and today and yesterday were all very difficult, but for
the sake of being and spreading positive, i would say it wasn't the worst.
There are a lot of things i need to improve on and i am seeing them more often
as major obstacles
##I need to improve on the following aspects
1. Understanding the functionality of loops and objects
2. Get better at data manipulation
3. get better at problem solving

in order to improve on the following aspect of my education, i found out that the
best way is by practice practice practice.
