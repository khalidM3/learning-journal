================================================================================

Today was a supposed to be an easy day, however, i encountered many technical
difficulties. Still being new to github, me and my programming partner had our
first git merge conflict as well as many other which took many hours to solve.
I would like to review the process again so i can understand it better, maybe
we will in the future.

However i need to:
1. Review the whole workflow process including forking and pull requests
2. How to push the files to github since git push origin master is showing
   errors
3. How to overcome merge conflicts more efficiently
4. common problems that occurs during git workflow collaborations
