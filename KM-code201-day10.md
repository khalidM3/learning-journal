               #KM CODE 201 DAY 10
============================================================================
The past two weeks were very interesting and though it sound very cliche', i
have to say i have learned a ton! The biggest things i have really reflected
upon this week was maintaining a growth mindset and challenging myself every
chance i get.

Now that i have discussed the achievements, sort of, i have to discuss the
problems i am currently facing. Css layouts! I am having a lot of problems
wen it comes to positioning html elements using css. I have read on it many
times but i think i need a more visual explanation like watching a descriptive
video on the topic although they are hard to come by.
