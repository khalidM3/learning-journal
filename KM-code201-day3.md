         #KM code 201 day 3
=====================================================================

this day was very stressful. The guessing game was so stressful. I didn't expect to struggle so much on a concept that sounded very easy. I had so much problems on the last question, but the biggest was trying to fix a bug but making ten more. I still didn't fully fix all the bugs but hopefully by tomorrow i can understand were i went wrong and fix and prevent those mistakes from happening in my future projects.

we also learned about the git workflow and team workflow. I am certain it will get more difficult, so i got to buckle up and drive.
