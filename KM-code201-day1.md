                 # KM code 201 day 1
===============================================================================
Today we learned about about a lot of things i already knew but more importantly
things i did not. One of the problems i had when i was teaching myself how to
code was the fact that there were all these small things that i didn't know but
together they became a big deal.

the new things i learned were
1. Getting to know github way better then i did before.
2. learning how to force remove directories with the ($ rm -fr) and ($ rm -r)
    and also how to permanently delete a whole hard drive.
3. how to code in the chrome dev env
4. shortcuts like (cdm k), (cmd s), (cmd r) etc.

The thing i most enjoy about the class so far is that i feel like having all
this practical work makes it easier to get use ro using all the new features
we have learned.
